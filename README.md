# Cluster-based_extraction_OnSSET
Developed in order to facilitate the GIS extraction for OnSSET when the population base layer in the analysis is a polygon layer

As of February 2021, there are three versions of the plugis:

* **Option 1**. Works for QGIS 3.10. Download QGIS 3.10 from the following [link](https://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.10.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe)
* **Archive** Works for QGIS 3.4 and 3.2. These versions are no longer updated and you are recommended to use the newer versions

**Note:** As of February 2021 support of Option 2 and 3 is discontinued. These versions can still be used, but troubleshooting and changes will exclusively target the 3.10 and 3.16 versions of the plugin.

### Introduction

The following repository includes an extraction plugin used in order to automate the GIS data extraction for cluster-based OnSSET analysis. The plugin is developed in a PyQGIS interface and adapted to be run direclty in QGIS (version 3.0 or newer). 

The repository includes a zipped plugin folder that can be directly installed into QGIS as well as instruction on how to install and run the plugin.
